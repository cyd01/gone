// The router package provides basic means of switching between the wiki's
// different page types.
// Those types are, for example, viewing a page, editing a page, logging in
// etc., and are called "modes".
//
// This package decides when to invoke the HTTP handler for which mode and
// provides logic for redirecting betweend those modes.
